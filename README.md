"Libft" rebuild of C system functions

This repo is a copy of the homonymous functions from the C system library, made from scratch, as required for the 42-network project.
Please bear in mind that the testing applied is limited and you should always prioritize the use of the original functions.
This project is for educational purposes only, and both unchecked errors and a lack of optimization should be expected.
For the same reason, please assume that there is a better, simpler, more optimized version of them, and that the approach suggested may not be the ideal.

The purpose of this project is to learn to manage pc resources at a lower level, replicating some basic functions
